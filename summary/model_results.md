WRITE RESULTS OF EACH MODEL AND HOW YOU came to the model briefly, what changes where made?

BASELINE(NO USING TO ENGINEERED SUFF)

model6: (squaring after outliers removal)
train RMSE = 0.3931 - R2 = 0.6946
validation RMSE = 0.3930 - R2 = 0.6949

model5: (no squaring)
train RMSE = 0.3931 - R2 = 0.6946
validation RMSE = 0.3930 - R2 = 0.6949

finalmodel: (squaring before outlier removal)
-- removed this model, but you may include the insight if you want. (Its literally by luck)
