# Trip-Duration-Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict trip duration based on extracted patterns from trip-related data.

... TODO

Include this?
Our goal in this EDA is to predict the log1p of trip_duration column,
The data is mostly clean so the EDA will be mainly focused on feature engineering to improve our model.
We will be using a Ridge model with alpha=1 as a fixed model to maximazie the experience of feature engineering.
