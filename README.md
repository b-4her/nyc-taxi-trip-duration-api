## Project Overview

The main idea of this project is to understand the end-to-end deployment process of a machine learning model, focusing on each step in the pipeline and gaining hands-on experience throughout.

The project starts with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and emphasizes feature engineering and data preprocessing. Multiple models were trained and evaluated to predict taxi trip durations based on trip-related features.

The final model is deployed using a FastAPI service, and a command-line interface (CLI) tool was built to interact with the API â€” simulating how such a system could be used in production.

one readme is enough, though start it with detailed toggels

mention directories navigation when necessary

Mention main goal to understand end to end production
